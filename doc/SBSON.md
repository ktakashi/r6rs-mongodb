# BSON in S-expression

NOTE: SBSON (S-expression BSON) is the term I made. So it's not used anywhere
in the world but here.

BSON is the binary format used by MongoDB. It's similar to JSON. Since it's
a binary format and human can't read binary easily, I'v created a new format
of BSON for Scheme.

## Specification

TBD

## Reference
